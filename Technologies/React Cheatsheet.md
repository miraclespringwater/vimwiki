# React Cheatsheet

## Babel Repel
* https://babeljs.io/repl

## JSX Cheatsheet
* https://jsx-notes.vercel.app/

## Converting HTML to JSX (HTML attributes -> JSX props)
1. All prop names follow camelCase
2. Number attributes use curly braces for input
3. Boolean 'true' can be asserted by just writing the property name. 'False' Should be written with curly braces.
4. The 'class' attribute is written as 'className'
5. In-line styles are provided as objects

## Basic Structure
* index.js:
    1. Import React and ReactDOM modules
    2. Import the App component
    3. Create a root
    4. Show the App Component
* App.js: Code to create a component

## Creating and Using a Component
1. Create a new file. By convention, filename should start with a capital letter
2. Make your component. Should be a function that returns JSX
3. Export the component at the bottom of the file
4. Import the component into another file
5. Use the component (reference as JSX)
